# Rlisp
## A simple interpreted Lisp built in Rust

 I'm building this as an educational project in my free time. It's in
 its incredibly early stages right now, but it runs and the functions
 `numberp`, `consp` and `cons` are all functional.
 
 If you want to give it a try, just run it with `cargo run`. I use
 Rust nightly out of habit, and I really have no clue whether or not
 this will compile on stable.
